# Soccer-open-api
Hello there! 
Here I have an example of the statistic of English Premier League for seasons 2021-2022.
To use it you just need to make sure the api key in config file is working.
This API is not free, it has a limit of 10 fetches a minute. So if you did over 10 fetches a minute it will not fetch data and it will be empty page with navigation bar.
Enjoy!
